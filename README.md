This app is a calculator designed to use an alternate syntax. Operands are placed before their arguments to eliminate the need for parentheses.

Examples:
* "3 + 2" would be represented as "+ 3 2"
* "(5 + 2) / (4 - 3) would be represented as "/ + 5 2 - 4 3"

Work in progress. The typescript will run correctly in an external compiler, but it does not yet accept input or run as-is. The calculator can currently only handle single-digit numbers and expressions without whitespace.
